    Overview:

        Shader program 'shd':
            Get shader desc: light_shd_shader_desc()
            Vertex shader: vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_light_vs_in_pos = 0
                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: light_vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_light_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: fs
                Uniform block 'fs_params':
                    C struct: light_fs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_light_fs_params = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader shd = sg_make_shader(light_shd_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_light_vs_in_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        light_vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .u_mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_light_vs_params, &vs_params, sizeof(vs_params));

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'fs_params':

        light_fs_params_t fs_params = {
            .u_color = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_light_fs_params, &fs_params, sizeof(fs_params));
